# Dashboard

The dashboard is your home base. It gathers the main StudyMate tools in one place so you can jump in fast.

What you will typically find:
- A quick start area for the focus timer.
- Shortcuts to Task Scheduler lists and todays priorities.
- The Motivation Vault teaser with the daily mantra.
- Live session cards for current or upcoming rooms.
- Leaderboard highlights and recent snapshots.
- Access to Ask AI for guidance about the app.
