# Live Stream Studio

Live Stream Studio is where study sessions happen. Sessions can be live now or scheduled for later.

What you can do:
- Join active sessions to study with others.
- Browse upcoming sessions and plan your next block.
- See how many participants are in a session and the max size.

Each session card shows the start and end time. Join a session to focus together in real time.
