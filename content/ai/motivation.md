# Motivation Vault

Motivation Vault is where the daily mantra lives. The mantra rotates once per day based on Asia/Tashkent time.

How it works:
- A new mantra appears at 00:00 (Tashkent).
- The mantra is a short focus prompt to repeat before a work block.
- You can pair the mantra with a timer session to start a study ritual.

Use the Motivation Vault page to read the full mantra card and the ritual tips.
